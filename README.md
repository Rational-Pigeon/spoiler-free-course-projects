# spoiler-free course-projects
I'm on a self-study journey to learn coding, computer science, and software engineering with the help of online courses (currently following [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)'s Curriculum and loving it!). Sometimes along the path, I have to undertake projects that offer creative freedom. Sharing these projects would not give away the solutions to any assignment. This repository is dedicated to my take on such projects.
